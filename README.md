LIFR %-Line Fill Rate ,  VOFR %-Volume Fill Rate,    OT %-On Time Delivery %,    IF %- In Full Delivery %,    OTIF %- On Time In Full %

•	Top KPI’s  like OT%, IF%, OTIF% have not reached target especially OTIF% have not reached 50% percent of the total target is the main reason for the customers not extending the annual contract 

•	Ontime and full time services have reached 66-67% of total target, if remaining 30-34% percent services are picked up , then these services can reach the target

•	VOFR% is on good tract covering 96.59% of the total which means total quantity is fullfilled as per orderlines. Remaining 3.4% will be covered if the undilvered quantity of 458K is delivered as per orderlines.

•	LIFR% will be increased if OTIF% is increased, which is directly linked to  OT% and IF%.

•	Top 4 customers by orders are Lotus mart, Acclaimed stores, Vijay stores, Rel Fresh of total orders above 3,600 but the fact is, these customers are least provided by the services. Based on the KPIs  comparision  (page3) they are listed in the bottom. If these customers are delivered ontime and infull the revenue can be on tract.

•	The undelivered diary product should improve to the highest because these diary product are ordered more compared to food and beverages.

•	Surat receives less orders over the time and Ahmedabad receive highest.

•	Even though Surat receives less orders but it fullfill KPI’s like OT%, IF% and their targets  upto the mark compared to other cities. To get the annual contract back more services to be provided to Ahmedabad and Vadodara. These cities to be given more pressure to deliver on time and in full.

•	Ontime delivery is 37K , delayed delivery (1, 2 and 3 days from actual delivery day) is 16k which should given important which is the main reason  for the problem.

•	More undelivered quantity  in Ahmedabad city which should be increased by increasing the staff number.
